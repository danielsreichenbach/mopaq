2. **Tests**: Add or update tests for your changes
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed

### Test Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, make sure to run:

```bash
# Format your code
cargo fmt

# Check for common issues
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Run tests
cargo test
```

If you've added a new feature, consider adding a benchmark:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## üöÄ Beginner's Guide to Open Source Contribution

New to open source or Rust? Here are some tips to get started:

### Understanding Git & GitHub

1. **Fork**: Creates your personal copy of the repository
2. **Clone**: Downloads the repository to your computer
3. **Branch**: Creates a separate workspace for your changes
4. **Commit**: Saves your changes with a message explaining what you did
5. **Push**: Uploads your changes to GitHub
6. **Pull Request**: Asks the project maintainers to review and merge your changes

### First-Time Contributor Tips

1. **Start small**: Fix a typo, improve documentation, or tackle a "good first issue"
2. **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or help
3. **Be patient**: Maintainers are often busy; give them time to respond
4. **Stay positive**: Be open to feedback and suggestions
