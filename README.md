A Rust library for reading and writing World of Warcraft MPQ archives, designed to be approachable, well-documented, and community-driven.

## ‚ú® What is this?

MPQ (Mo'PQ or Mike O'Brien Pack) is the archive format used by Blizzard Entertainment's games including World of Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft. This library allows you to:

- Read existing MPQ archives
- Create new MPQ archives
- Extract files from archives
- Add files to archives
- And more!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Add the library to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
mopaq = "0.1.0"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use mopaq::{MpqArchive, Result};
use std::path::Path;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Open an existing WoW MPQ archive
    let archive = MpqArchive::open("path/to/your/wow.mpq")?;
    println!("Archive opened successfully!");

    // Print some basic information
    println!("Format version: {}", archive.header.format_version);
    println!("Contains user header: {}", archive.user_header.is_some());

    // Create a new MPQ archive (format version 1)
    let new_archive = MpqArchive::create("path/to/new.mpq", 1)?;
    println!("Created a new archive!");

    Ok(())
}
```

### <a name="mpq-basics"></a>What are MPQ Archives?

MPQ (Mo'PQ or Mike O'Brien Pack) is an archive format created by Blizzard Entertainment. It's used in many of their games to package game assets like models, textures, sounds, and more.

Key features of the MPQ format:

- File compression
- Built-in encryption
- Support for multiple languages
- Fast file lookup through hash tables

### <a name="rust-basics"></a>Rust Basics for This Project

This library makes use of several Rust concepts:

- **Result/Option types**: For proper error handling
- **Traits**: For consistent interfaces
- **Ownership**: For memory safety without garbage collection
- **Modules**: For code organization

Don't worry if you're not familiar with all of these‚Äîour documentation explains the concepts as they come up!

### <a name="common-tasks"></a>Common Tasks

#### Opening an Archive

```rust
let archive = MpqArchive::open("game.mpq")?;
```

#### Creating a New Archive

```rust
let archive = MpqArchive::create("new.mpq", 1)?;
```

#### Extracting a File

```rust
// Coming soon!
```
